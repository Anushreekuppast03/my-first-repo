    <p>i. getchar(): Reading a Character ( Input function)
         Whenever we want to read a character from the keyboard and store this character into a memory location, then getchar() function is used.
        Syntax:
        variable_name = getchar();
         variable_name is a valid C name that has been declared as char type.
         When this statement is encountered, the computer waits until a key is pressed and assigns this character as a value to getchar function 2.2.1 Formatted Output Function: print statement
         The data stored in memory locations has to be converted into appropriate data type and then it is displayed on the screen for human understanding in the proper format. This can be done by “printf statement”.
         Print and Format: The function printf (print+f) prints the data in the specified memory location or variables after “formatting” the data.
        printf(): print format
         There are two simple forms of printf:
        1. One that has just a literal string (a sequence of characters within quotation marks)
        General form: printf (“……….”);

        literal string
        Ex : printf (“welcome to jit”);
        Literal string is placed within a parenthesis. The symbols within that string are printed.
